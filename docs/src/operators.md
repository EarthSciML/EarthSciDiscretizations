# Operators

## The closed authoring vocabulary

A discretization rule's `replacement` MUST be expressible in the §4.2 op
vocabulary alone. That vocabulary is *closed*: every binding (Julia,
Python, future host) walks the same AST, and no rule introduces new
ops. The vocabulary covers everything an FV scheme needs — including
limiters, reconstructions, and weighted-stencil schemes — without any
scheme-specific dispatch.

The full list, summarized from `esm-spec.md` §4.2 (consult that section
for the authoritative form):

### PDE operators (`applies_to.op` and tendency expressions)

| Op | Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `D` | `wrt` | Time derivative ∂/∂t |
| `grad` | `dim` | Spatial gradient ∂/∂x |
| `div` | | Divergence ∇· |
| `laplacian` | | Laplacian ∇² |

These four (plus pointwise math, below) are the PDE-operator alphabet
that authors pattern-match against. A rule's `applies_to.op` MUST be
one of them.

### Pointwise math

Arithmetic: `+` (n-ary), `-` (unary or binary), `*` (n-ary), `/`
(binary), `^` (binary).

Elementary functions: `exp`, `log`, `log10`, `sqrt`, `abs`, `sign`,
`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `min` (n-ary,
≥2 args), `max` (n-ary, ≥2 args), `floor`, `ceil`.

`min` / `max` are the canonical encoding of clamp / clip / limiter
primitives — `clamp(x, lo, hi)` is `min(hi, max(lo, x))`. Reviewers
reject `fn` nodes that re-implement these in disguise.

### Conditionals

`ifelse [cond, then, else]`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `and`,
`or`, `not`. Conditional logic in lowerings (e.g. flux-limiter switches)
goes through `ifelse`; there is no `if`-statement primitive.

### Inline constants and registry calls

`const` (literal value), `enum` (file-local symbolic name), `fn`
(invocation of a closed-registry function — `name` is a dotted path).
Most FV rules need none of these; mention them only when shipping a
table of coefficients inline (`const`) or a registry-level helper.

### Array / tensor ops (`replacement` body)

| Op | Required fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `arrayop` | `output_idx`, `expr` | Generalized Einstein-notation tensor expression with implicit reductions over non-output indices. (§4.3.1.) |
| `makearray` | `regions`, `values` | Block assembly from overlapping sub-region assignments; later regions overwrite earlier ones. (§4.3.2.) |
| `index` | — | Element / sub-array access. `args[0]` is the array; `args[1..]` are index expressions. (§4.3.3.) |
| `broadcast` | `fn` | Element-wise application of scalar op `fn`. (§4.3.4.) |
| `reshape` | `shape` | Reshape the operand to a target shape. (§4.3.5.) |
| `transpose` | optional `perm` | Axis permutation. (§4.3.5.) |
| `concat` | `axis` | Concatenate operand arrays along `axis`. (§4.3.5.) |

`arrayop` is the workhorse: every closed-AST FV lowering in the
catalog ultimately resolves to one or more `arrayop` nodes whose body
combines `index`, arithmetic, and (for nonlinear schemes) `ifelse` and
`broadcast`.

## What the vocabulary excludes

Rules MUST NOT introduce off-spec match keys or scheme-named ops in
either `applies_to.op` or anywhere inside `replacement`. The following
names are forbidden:

| Forbidden as `op` | Right answer |
|---|---|
| `advect` | match `D(q, wrt=t)` (or whichever PDE op the scheme discretizes) and lower the advective tendency as an `arrayop`. |
| `reconstruct` | the reconstruction is the body of the `arrayop` — express the polynomial in `+`, `*`, `index`. |
| `flux` | flux assembly is an `arrayop` whose `output_idx` ranges over edges and whose body is the numerical-flux formula in pointwise math + `ifelse`. |
| `limit` / `limiter` | encode the limiter as `min` / `max` / `ifelse` directly. |
| `bc:*` | boundary handling is declared on the domain (`esm-spec.md` §11.5) and applied by downstream BC rules; no `bc:*` op exists in the lowered AST. |

The rule of thumb: if the only justification for a new op name is "this
scheme calls it that", it is the wrong move. Express the math in the
existing alphabet. If a scheme genuinely cannot be expressed — bring it
to the spec authors before authoring the rule.

The companion prohibition is on **scheme-specific kernels in any host
language**. Rules ship JSON, not Julia or Python. The reference
evaluator (`evaluate_arrayop` and the ESS walker) implements the §4.2
vocabulary once; rules borrow that implementation by composition.

## Worked sanity checks

The closed-AST lowerings produced by the catalog satisfy the same basic
invariants any FV operator must — they are still operators on arrays,
just authored differently. The following examples evaluate the AST that
the rules emit, confirming each invariant holds.

### Laplacian of a constant

The Laplacian of a constant field is zero everywhere. `fv_laplacian` is
the de-facto numeric reference for the schema-gated covariant Laplacian
on the cubed sphere (see
`discretizations/finite_difference/covariant_laplacian_cubed_sphere.json`,
which currently declares `applicable: false` pending ESS multi-axis
selectors and metric-tensor bindings).

```@example ops
using EarthSciDiscretizations
using EarthSciDiscretizations: evaluate_arrayop

grid = CubedSphereGrid(8)
Nc = grid.Nc

phi_const = fill(42.0, 6, Nc, Nc)
ao = fv_laplacian(phi_const, grid)
lap = evaluate_arrayop(ao)
println("Laplacian of constant field:")
println("  Size: $(size(lap))")
println("  Max absolute value: $(maximum(abs.(lap)))")
```

### Transport of a constant field

Advecting a constant field produces zero tendency regardless of the
velocity field.

```@example ops
q_const = fill(5.0, 6, Nc, Nc)
courant_xi = fill(0.3, 6, Nc, Nc)
courant_eta = fill(-0.2, 6, Nc, Nc)

ao = transport_2d(q_const, courant_xi, courant_eta, grid)
tendency = evaluate_arrayop(ao)
println("Transport tendency of constant field:")
println("  Size: $(size(tendency))")
println("  Max absolute value: $(maximum(abs.(tendency)))")
```
